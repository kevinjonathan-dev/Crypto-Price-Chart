# Crypto Price Chart

This project was created to serve as a substitution for the crypto chart project. It was intended to showcase what I have made without disclosing any confidential information of the company, as the feature I made was not released to public yet.

## Design

The design however, is really different. In my job I was tasked to follow the mock up design exactly to pixel-perfection. Here, I have more freedom and gave it my own touch and a simpler design, playing with colours and gradients.

### Installation
